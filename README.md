# ***THE TRAFFIC MONITORING SYSTEM (TSMS)***

***PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT.***

The TSMS is used to monitor or detect the over speeding of a car. The TSMS can also prevent the over-taking of cars within the traffic range
which can lead to the prevention of car accidents.
The TSMS can be operated by only one person, thus, the admin. The admin receives pictures of the cars over speeding from the TSMS to the 
interface.
